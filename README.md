# Text Editor PWA
## Description
- This project's goal was to build a full stack text editor that runs in the browser.
- This app meets PWA criteria by being installable, and also features data persistence techniques with IndexedDB as the database. 
- The app is built to ensure that users can see whatever they type in the app even if they close out of the browser, are offline, or switch to the downloaded version of the app.
